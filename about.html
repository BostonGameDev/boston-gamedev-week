    	<h1>About</h1>
        <p>Boston Gamedev Week is hosted by Boston Game Dev, a 501(c)3 non-profit dedicated to supporting Boston-area game developers made up of three organizations:</p>

        <p><strong>Boston Post Mortem</strong> is Boston’s official chapter of the International Game Developer’s Association. BPM has been doing game development meetups in the greater Boston area since the turn of the century. BPM hosts all manner of events, including talks from industry professionals, portfolio reviews, or sometimes just chill networking nights to chat with fellow game developers.

        <p><strong>Boston Indies</strong> is a community of independent game developers in Massachusetts supporting hobbyists, professionals, artists, academics, and anyone else who's excited about making games.</p>

        <p><strong>Game Audio Boston</strong> is the place for all game audio professionals in New England and those aspiring to become ones to meet, discuss, share knowledge, and grow together. As part of the Boston Game Dev group, we host monthly virtual and in-person meetups with guest speakers.</p>

        <p>If you'd like to help Boston Game Dev to support efforts like this, you can <a href="https://secure.givelively.org/donate/boston-game-dev-inc/boston-game-dev">make a tax-deductible donation.</a> This, along with all our Boston Game Dev events, is run entirely by volunteers relying on donations such as this.</p>
