### Directions

#### Via MBTA
Via the MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority) subway system, known as the “T.” Kendall Square is easily accessible via the Red Line.

The Kendall/MIT station is centrally located in the Kendall Square area and The Link is a short walk from the MBTA station.
